<div class="post">
<p>So I need to prime the pump of this post with a bit of foreword. It should be noted that I am decidedly NOT a mac fanboi. I&#8217;ve used a fair portion of their kit over the years for a variety of purposes, both liesure and work related. From the technical perspective, I have evaluated their products on those basis, and am willing to state the following things about their products and mentality:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They have, on a regular basis, been able to innovate decidedly outside of the box</li>
  <li>Their ecosystem is proprietary and exclusionary, and has allowed them to make gobs of money at the expense of a healthy market (they are definitely NOT the only company guilty of such practices. That doesn&#8217;t make the fact any better)</li>
  <li>iTunes software and store sucks. Sorry, it just does. And it is getting worse as time goes on</li>
  <li>Their products are incredibly sexy. They take aesthetic design to a level that most companies don&#8217;t even know exist, many more simply emulate, and almost noone can rival. Off the charts</li>
  <li>They have excellent support, in my experience. I&#8217;ve not had to make that much use of it over the years, but when I&#8217;ve had to, it has not let me down</li>
  <li>They have managed to create a brand and consumer loyalty index that is also rarely rivaled. Those who have bought in are damn near rabid. In markets where there are so many other options, and in the few cases where an otherwise healthy competitive market exists for the particular product set&#8230; that is pretty invaluable, and might have been one of the most important reasons they&#8217;ve stayed in business during some of the tougher times</li>
  <li>They support educational markets. I dig that. Even if it isn&#8217;t for purely altruistic reasons, they at least recognize that it pays off in the long run, and have (and continue to) leverage this fact. Well played, sirs &#8230; well played</li>
  <li>I&#8217;m not fond of their pricing model. I speculate that part of their strategy is (or at least, was), to play to people&#8217;s vanity and price their products as the &#8220;premium&#8221; model in the markets they participate in. Yes, sure&#8230; I can chalk some of that up to needing to recover the costs associated with their high quality of engineering and design, but not that much. Also, it just isn&#8217;t true anymore. Yet they still participate in their markets with prices 20% or higher than the nearest equivalent product, and I&#8217;m sorry, but those differences in product that were once arguably differential are, quite simply, no longer true</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so now you know my stance on them. I own several of their products, and where I can rationalize the price, I may very well purchase them in the future as well. But at the moment, my general &#8220;one liner&#8221; about their current product set is &#8220;I&#8217;m kind of over them&#8221;.</p>

<p>Well, that was yesterday. This is today. And holy shit. If I really take a damn hard look at this, and try to noodle out what the real differences are between this product (that I&#8217;m about to link) and its competitors &#8230; the list is probably reasonably short, but not insignificant. However, maybe its just I&#8217;ve got that glossy sexy shiny thing making my eyes all blurry and all, but HOLY SHIT. Apple, I gotta hand it to you&#8230; you make some sexy stuff. Without further ado&#8230; please feast your eyes:</p>
