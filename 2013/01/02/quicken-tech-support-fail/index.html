<div class="post">
<p>Here is a redacted cut/paste of a conversation I just had with Quicken Tech Support. I&#8217;ve redacted the name of the support person because I have no interest in throwing anyone under the bus. My initial question was to find out if there was any special/upgrade pricing as a long time user, and what the new features were. I will leave you to make your own conclusions&#8230;</p>

<p>XXXXX: Hi, my name is XXXXX. Thank you for contacting Quicken, please allow me a moment to read your question.<br />
XXXXX: Hi Mark, how are you doing today?</p>

<p>me: very well, thanks. Happy New Years.</p>

<p>XXXXX: Thank you and happy new year to you to.<br />
XXXXX: I would like to inform you that there is no update price available while upgrading from 2010 to 2013, however as you are a valuable customer, I am providing you with a link to get $20 discount.</p>

<p>me: that would be great, thank you.</p>

<p>XXXXX: http://quicken.intuit.com/blahblahblah</p>

<p>me: that is for the rental property manager<br />
me: is there one for home and business?</p>

<p>XXXXX: You can scroll down, you will see it at the bottom of that page&#8230;</p>

<p>me: ah, nevermind, I just switched products, and the discount is still there.<br />
me: Excellent.<br />
me: so. final question&#8230; are the new features worth the upgrade? Last year, I was told there wasn&#8217;t anything significant changed<br />
me: (by support)</p>

<p>XXXXX: Yes, there are many new feature plus the Mobile app.<br />
XXXXX: Are you satisfied with the support I provided today and my efforts to help? If not, how else can I help you?</p>

<p>me: ok, thank you, I&#8217;ll look into it. Actually, I do have one final support type question<br />
me: I&#8217;m trying hard to reduce the size of the file I work with.<br />
me: its currently 40Meg + and the performance of quicken is suffering as a result<br />
me: I&#8217;m trying to do a year-end copy to get rid of pre-2006 data<br />
me: and after I do that, the file size is STILL over 40M (no reduction in size)<br />
me: what am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>XXXXX: I would like to inform you that Year end feature is not working currently you can try the copy option to archive your file<br />
XXXXX: Are you satisfied with the support I provided today and my efforts to help? If not, how else can I help you?</p>

<p>me: does it work better in 2013?<br />
me: or work at all?</p>

<p>XXXXX: It is not working in 2013 as well.</p>

<p>me: thank you. Yes, I&#8217;m satisfied with your support.<br />
me: have a great day</p>
