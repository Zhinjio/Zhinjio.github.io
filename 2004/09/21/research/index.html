<div class="post">
<p>things to research:</p>

<p>diseases, bioweapons and distribution vectors<br />
virus effects, incubation, inception of symptoms, manifestation and durations of these stages before death<br />
where during those periods are the various virii considered infectious, and if the vectors vary by stage, how</p>

<p>locations for various bioweapons facilities in the world, and where various<br />
toxics are stored and/or researched</p>

<p>areas where heavy pollution effects occur. projections of global warming effects, including rising sea levels, temperature increases (or decreases due to to ocean current degradation), increasingly severe weather (hurricanes, tornados, general patterns of weather formation and densities of these types of severe weather). Include trending over the past 30 years. Make sure to include on an international level, not just US centric. Earthquake and fault data. See if there are maps of faults throughout the US. Can large scale nuclear deployment on US soil trigger faults? If so, which ones and what effects might these have on our current shorelines/land masses. Volcano activity (probably limited to west coast and alaska). Pacific Ring of Fire. </p>

<p>I need to come up with a new world map that include blast zones, radiated zones, waste islands, and areas that are severely affected by tidal, global warming or other weather effects. Whats left?</p>

<p>Try and project the path technology might have taken in terms of computing and communications in the years up to the collapse. That is the &#8216;ground zero&#8217; point where all research would be stopped. Keep in mind that the years preceeding the collapse were pushing Internet communications industry down, and not as much innovation would have occurred. Mass storage would also have been slowed, while high speed computing and processing would have continued.</p>

<p>Anything technology wise that would have benefitted military applications would have continued in force.</p>

<p>Need maps form the major network providers one their backbones, US and international. What lines would be affected by nuclear/weather worsening and what would be left largely intact.</p>

<p>Need maps of railroad routes that are actively used (Groot?) and what they principally carry anymore. Shipping lanes, major ports of entry for shipping. What would be left after ocean levels rise?</p>

<p>Current nuclear power facilities, both here and overseas. What would the effect of cutting off their electricity be? Assume some safeguarding systems about removing rods from reactors when cooling/electricity is removed, but assume also that some of the older ones would have accidents, also contributing to the world&#8217;s &#8220;dead zones&#8221;.</p>

<p>Assume that research into alternative power means would have continued, but underfunded and not much better than today. That should include wind/solar/water (offshore turbines, etc).</p>
