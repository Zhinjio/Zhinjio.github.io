<p>As a general rule, I&#8217;m not a big fan of the medical industry. No, I don&#8217;t need the qualify that, I&#8217;m <strong>not</strong> a fan of the medical industry. I don&#8217;t go as far down that road as some others. Some people I know wouldn&#8217;t go to a doctor unless their leg was only loosely attached. I value the services that <strong>specific</strong> physicians and surgeons provide, when it is needed. Thats the key right there, I guess. I do believe that the human body has an amazing recuperative ability. Astonishing, really &#8230; when you consider all of the complex systems involved just to do something as simple as a cut on your skin healing. So when I absolutely need some kind of care, its usually at the point when I&#8217;ve accepted that either a) my body&#8217;s ability to heal some particular thing isn&#8217;t good enough, or b) that the healing process is too painfully slow for me to tolerate the pain any longer. </p>

<p>Today was just such an event. I am prone to ear infections. Moving to Colorado has been mostly good things, and at least this one bad thing. The lack of humidity in the air means that the skin on the inside of my ear canal is very dry, and itchy. Jamming my finger in there to relieve the itching has a tendency to introduce some bad stuff in there that sometimes gets infected to a lesser (or in this case, greater) degree. The side of my head is kinda puffy. My ear canal is all but completely swollen shut. When she went poking in there with the little light scopey thing, she couldn&#8217;t even see my eardrum. Middle ear infection at minimum, and possibly also inner ear (that would be normal for me). So what do they do for this? Usually, you get a systemic antibiotic to handle the infection from the body perspective, and then a topical one (ear drops) to handle the part that is external to the bloodstream. Only one problem. When the ear canal is so swollen shut that the drops can&#8217;t reach the parts (or some of the parts) that are infected, they have to insert a &#8216;wick&#8217;. Ok, so your ear canal is dry, irritated, infected, tender and painful. I can&#8217;t imagine a more soothing experience than stuffing a dry, chafing cloth wick down in there. Not so much. </p>

<p>I have scales of pain. In your typical scale of 1 to 10, dental pain and gout are competing for first place at 9 or 10. That singular event registered at about an 8. Most things below a 7 don&#8217;t even really annoy me too much, or my tolerance for them is sufficient to keep me going without any medication needed. This was so sudden and acute that I nearly threw up on the attending nurse. God. All in the name of getting better. The alternatives aren&#8217;t acceptable.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll save my ranting and raving about big pharma companies and the HMOs for another post when I&#8217;ve settled down. </p>
