          <h2>Minor upgrade</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Oct 2004</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I was starting to finally reach the point where I needed a new hard drive. So this is where the geek in me really kicks in. I want to investigate all the options, examine all the different speeds, formats, capacities, cache sizes, and even cabling that is available.</p>

<p>So the first realization is that this will not be the end-all-be-all upgrade. The intent is to get me over the immediate problem I have of being low on space while, not compromise on performance and not hit the bank account too heavily either.</p>

<p>So, first decision: SATA, IDE or SCSI. For the first time ever, I&#8217;m not going down the SCSI road this time. For the extra money you pay, you&#8217;re simply not getting enough value anymore. For a quick comparison, here&#8217;s the largest SCSI drive available from <a href="http://www.allstarshop.com/">one of my favorite hardware vendors</a> compared with the IDE drive I settled on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Maxtor Atlas IV 147.1GB 10K RPM Ultra320 80-pin HDD (Drive Only)</code><br />
Price: $692.75</li>
  <li><code>Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 PLUS 200GB 7200RPM 8MB Buffer ATA/100 HDD (Drive Only)</code><br />
Price: $121.00</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, yes, 10000 RPM. I agree, thats faster than the IDE, but Jesus Maria, thats almost 6 times the price. No, I&#8217;m sorry, that just won&#8217;t fly anymore.</p>

<p>Ok, so SATA? After doing a bunch of reading, my general feeling is that eventually, I will switch over to SATA. Just not yet. Why? Well, for one thing, I don&#8217;t need it yet. SATA has two real advantages for me: speed and expandability. However, right now, the speed argument is limited by my current motherboard. Until I do an upgrade on the motherboard that has a higher backplane bus speed and/or onboard SATA support and/or PCI-E bus support, there&#8217;s really no advantage. As far as expandability is concerned, SATA *does* offer many more device possibilities than standard IDE. For right now, these drives I&#8217;ve just purchased will last me into the near future. Let&#8217;s say a year or more. So once I make the commitment down the road to do a full system upgrade, then SATA may come up again. For now, not necessary. Oh, and just for completeness, here&#8217;s some SATA pricing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Maxtor DiamondMax 10 300GB 7200RPM 16MB Buffer SATA HDD (White Label)</code><br />
Price: $210.00</li>
  <li><code>Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 200GB 7200RPM 8MB Buffer SATA HDD (Drive Only)</code><br />
Price: $123.00</li>
</ul>

<p>Very reasonable. So down the road, this will definitely be worth further investigation. The &#8220;old&#8221; IDE bus may very well relegated to just CD/DVD type devices. That would be nice.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also now considering a home network upgrade to go wireless. With the advent of 802.11g, there&#8217;s now a secure, high speed mechanism in place that is reasonable in price as well. I&#8217;m not committed to it yet, but I&#8217;m getting closer.</p>

<p>Finally, we got a Digital Voice Recorder for the wife. Birthday time, and this was her wish. She&#8217;s going to lots of boring lectures, and having a voice recorder lets her sleep in class without missing anything. Very important. I&#8217;ll post the model in this post once we&#8217;ve received it. No sense spoiling the surprise (or whats left of it).</p>
