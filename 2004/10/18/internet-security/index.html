<p>So after 4 or 5 failed attempts to reload my wife&#8217;s machine with XP Pro and associated stuff, I finally buckled down and took the hard road. I followed my own advice to friends about the proper methods for installing a machine securely, and keeping it secure. It worked. But Jesus, this is scary stuff.</p>

<p>So in the early steps of the installation, for the XP CD and the SP1 CD I burned, the network is unplugged. I also have an applications CD burned which has the firewall on it (<a href="http://www.tinysoftware.com/home/tiny2?la=EN">Tiny Personal Firewall, if you must know</a>), which I then installed. Also installed the virus checker (<a href="http://www.trendmicro.com/en/products/desktop/pc-cillin/evaluate/overview.htm">PCcillin</a>), and did the first of many rounds of virus checking. Once again, this is before its actually been live on any network.</p>

<p>Everything clean to this point, so I figure out which interface (there are two in the machine, one for the private home network) is which, and IPify the external interface, and finally, plug it in. Immediately switch over to the firewall configuration and put it into the &#8216;connected to an unsafe network&#8217; category, and sit back a bit to watch. 26 attacks in the first 10 minutes. Not bad. I download the virus checker updates, and rescan the whole machine. Still clean.</p>

<p>Next step is windows updates, which also go on smoothly (no, I didn&#8217;t install SP2). Five or six reboots later, and the machine&#8217;s pretty much ready for primetime. Clean installation, no current viruses, and based on current patterns, roughly 2-3 attacks per minute on various ports. Gotta love the little kiddies with their scripts. Oh well. If television has taught me anything, its that with great power comes great responsibility. And right now, it appears that to utilize the great power of the Internet, I (and everyone else with any interest in keeping their machines clean) has the responsibility of parenting a bajillion script kiddies and their fucking brainless attacks.</p>

<p>Bah, I say. BAH.</p>

<p>(EDIT) At some point, I will publish the step by step how to on installing a machine (from the OS perspective at least) in a safe manner to keep out the unwanted. (/EDIT)</p>
