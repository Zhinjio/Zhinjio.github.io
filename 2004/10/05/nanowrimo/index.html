<p>I&#8217;ve decided to participate in this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">Nanowrimo</a>. Thats an exceptionally weird way to say &#8216;National Novel Writing Month&#8217;. Go check out their site if you&#8217;re not familiar. You can involve yourself with the site as much or as little as you like.</p>

<p>For me, the value is mostly in just the initial motivation. I&#8217;ve always felt like I had the ability to produce a written work of some quality. Publishable? No idea. But there&#8217;s one way to find out, and setting a goal like this is certainly one way to provide that initial incentive. If this is successful, and better yet, if the idea pans out into something worthy of actually putting to a publisher and letting loose on the world, so much the better. Its certainly something I would enjoy doing as a career if it was something that could support me.</p>

<p>Anyway &#8230; we&#8217;ll see what happens. I suspect that my failings in this, should they appear will not be in the ability to produce 50,000 words. I think that once I get started on a topic, I can just keep going. I think my main failings will be in consistency of style. I tend to write in a fairly freeform fashion, and that isn&#8217;t necessarily conducive to good readable material. This is definitely something worth exploring, despite that.</p>
