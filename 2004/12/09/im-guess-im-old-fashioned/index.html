<div class="post">
<p>Cynicism doesn&#8217;t really fit me. I don&#8217;t like thinking that way, nor having to think that way in order to rationalize a perceived behavior, but you know&#8230; thats just the way the world works sometimes. I suppose once you&#8217;ve worked for enough companies, or enough larger companies, you will eventually meet people who meet a certain criteria. Namely, those who would seek to rise through corporate ranks and achieve whatever element of success they want through manipulation and exploitation.</p>

<p>Is it so wrong to still believe the right way to go about doing that is by achievement, skill and honorable business practices? I suppose not, but perhaps its just naive to think that everyone would seek to take that path. I don&#8217;t even claim to be the holder of some holier-than-thou work ethic, or whatever, but to some of these people, concepts like loyalty, friendship and integrity have no place in their worlds. Sad, really. I suppose it has just always seemed the better path to prove value through deed instead of word. Furthermore, I know it works. It isn&#8217;t necessarily a fast process, nor easy. But its definitely satisfying. And not just &#8216;job well done&#8217; satisfying, but also satisfying in the opinions that other people have of you, and how those get reflected back to you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve heard about you &#8230; you&#8217;re the one who did X, Y and Z when noone else was willing to&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hey, I finally get to meet you, I&#8217;ve heard so much about you from person A, B and C&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the company taking care of you? We need to make sure you&#8217;re getting what you need&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You let me know if you&#8217;re not happy where you&#8217;re at, I have room for someone like you anytime&#8221;</p>

<p>Tell me it isn&#8217;t satisfying to hear those sorts of comments. I&#8217;ve heard all of those within the last week. How you <strong>react</strong> to those statements is an entirely different matter, and depends on how humble you are, etc, but just to hear them makes alot of effort otherwise expended into the ether worthwhile.</p>

<p>So to those who would succeed through shortcuts, exploitation of relationships (or anything else, really), or manipulation of the truth to further your own ends, regardless of what other consequence that may have, or who else you might be hurting with those actions &#8230;. I tell you this:</p>

<p>You will never, ever hear those words. You will never, ever have the satisfaction of knowing your salary, position and compensation are DESERVED. I realize, those are hollow words, because you don&#8217;t care about that. Oh well. Your loss.</p>
