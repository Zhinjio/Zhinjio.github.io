<p>I love technology. I really do. I think its one of the core things about me that just drives my being. Its a difficult field, constantly in motion and driven by a strange set of forces. On one side of the rolling ball, there are the monolith companies driving billions of dollars into research to come up with &#8220;the next big thing&#8221;. On the other side are the small companies, even sometimes single people &#8230; who hit it big with an amazing idea, new invention, or new use for some existing thing. Either way, there is this momentum of progress that keeps the geeks of the world slathering through their webpages, tech news sites and magazines to see what toy they get to play with next.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had discussions with folks in the past who think we should still be swinging around in the trees by our tails, happily spending our days with simple thoughts. There&#8217;s something to be said for that, I agree. Simplicity has its rewards &#8230; life remains predictable, stable and comfortable. On the other hand, there&#8217;s an inate curiosity in me that has to <strong>know</strong> what the framerate I can push is using the latest video card with Far Cry, or what improvements I can get in my rendering projects by switching to a 3GHz processor instead of a 2GHz one. I mean, I <strong>really</strong> want to know. Y&#8217;know? No? Oh well.</p>

<p>This is also a pretty complex general topic. There&#8217;s all kinds of mini-asides that can be made about technology &#8230; our dependence on it, research driving its advancement, controls on it, and so on, so I fully expect to address many more of those topics at some later time. For now, though &#8230; I just wanted to be clear about my fascination with it, and leave it at that.</p>
