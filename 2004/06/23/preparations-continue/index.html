<p>This time of year always feels like you can never quite do enough to get everything in place before the people begin to arrive. Cesium was first this year, but only because he&#8217;s moving out here. Everyone else is being good and checking in around Friday.</p>

<p>I need to try and reach Tooker/Danno to see if they want to take crash space in les Casa des Hombres to save themselves a bit of cash. I seem to recall something being said about cutting the trip short due principally to hotel bills, etc &#8230; so that might very well help out.</p>

<p>Lots left to do. 6:30am concall at work, 8am all hands (CJ), 9am meet with Morris(server at the ok prompt) and 10am normal staff meeting with people who could care less. Hopefully, after all that, I&#8217;ll have put in sufficiently much time to release me from duties for the day. At least, assuming I can get Susan over into the lab with a good list of stuff. We&#8217;ll see. </p>

<p>On the list for today at home? Call eye doctor (thanks Sasha &#8230; my glasses really did need replacing anyway), call Western to remove the big ass garbage bin, dig out second horseshoe pit, clean desk, NOT play <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">WoW</a>. Yeah, right.</p>

<p>I will say, though, thats its really great to have Cesium out here. Its about damn time. Hmm, let&#8217;s see&#8230;. who can I convert next. </p>

<p>Due to extenuating circumstances, the Church of Potts will not be in session this week. It seems the worshiping is taking a field trip to a remote location. The king is dead, long live the King.</p>
