          <h2>Vacation thoughts</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>It almost seems as if I&#8217;m on vacation from myself. I forgot everything I was supposed to do for work. It required force of will to remember those things again. Man, apparently I really needed a break from all this.</p>

<p>It was a fairly low profile week. Played a decent round of golf with Jason, and then subsequently, probably one of my worst rounds ever with Sky, John and Rob. Ah well, I got some good advice from them, so it was definitely worth it. If I can find some time, I&#8217;m going to grab a lesson from someone. Golfing, if nothing else, is another sport where you&#8217;re sort of competing mainly against yourself (first and foremost). It reminds me of pool (billiards) in that regard. Body control, perception, consistency, assessment, etc. They are all elements of both. </p>

<p>I should listen to my own advice that I give others when teaching them pool. Start with the absolute basics. In this case, I still need to learn what all those are. Stance, grip, body position, arm position, backswing, etc. Once again, all the same terms from pool. I need to either rent some video or something, or spend some time with a pro who can get me those basics. Once those are consistent, then I can start working on all the nuances that make up the rest of the game. Before then, the rest of it is silly to focus on. It&#8217;ll get there.</p>

<p>Talk to Sky about the pool league team. I&#8217;m going to sit the next session out in order to make sure the whole team can play without hindrance of worrying about ranking out of a match. The APA has a rule that says that you can&#8217;t have more than 23 &#8220;points&#8221; of players play in given week. The ranks vary from 2 to 7 in 8-ball. Since I&#8217;m currently shooting as a 7, if I play, that means (currently) that not only MUST Ella play, but we also can&#8217;t play two 5&#8242;s in that week either. Me sitting out a session will get the discussion going as to what to do with the team longer term. Sky and I discussed splitting into two teams, etc &#8230; but I think we&#8217;ll just wait and see what happens this session and how the discussion develops.</p>

<p>Played alot of WoW and AC. Go figure. In AC, StormWlf was around this week, and Friday night, we had the Queen&#8217;s Quest which I went on for the first time ever, and got the kill! Holy smokes. Lemme see if I can link in a screenshot of that&#8230;. <a href="http://geo.trippy.org/images/QQ.png">there we go QQ.png (148K)</a>. Quite a fun ride. Thanks again to all the PL, and Lyc as well, who joined us for the mayhem. We will definitely be doing that again.</p>

<p>WoW has been pretty crashy since the last push. Seems like they&#8217;re trying to push alot of new function in at once. This last push was Auction Houses, the beginnings of the talent system, level cap raise, etc. Its been hard to quest with how much its gone down. But then again, thats what Beta is all about, right? They&#8217;re definitely making progress though.</p>

<p>Ah well, more later.</p>
