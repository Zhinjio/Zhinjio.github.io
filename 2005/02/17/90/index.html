      So I was recently down in the Data Center, doing my usual overnight equipment setup, configuration, cable making or whatever. I had received a set of Sennheiser MX 500 earbud style headphones for Christmas, and I was listening to my iPod with them. Their cord length is just about perfect, maybe a touch too short, but generally, if I run them down my back, it keeps the wires from getting in my way, and I keep my front clear and can still listen to my tunes. Continued use, though, showed me that my ears just aren&#8217;t shaped real well to hold onto the buds very well, and over time, they need to be fidgeted with to get them to stay in, and even then, I&#8217;m not getting what I would consider well focused, directed sound.<br /><br />
        So in doing a bit more research, the next best option seemed to be neckband style headphones. Having heard good things about Sennheiser, and having experienced the quality of the sound on the earbuds, I figured I&#8217;d try their product in this line, the PMX 60. The basic specs and a quick click on the &#8216;Technical Data&#8217; link will show some pretty impressive figures for sound clarity and quality. But you know&#8230; ultimately, I need to listen to them. I want it loud, with very wide range songs, and I want it directed well along the &#8216;sound path&#8217; in my ears. I just received them, and have since listened to them on a variety of sources, from the iPod to my computer to the output from the stereo/tv receiver.<br /><bg />
        Holy crap are these things nice. The sound clarity is excellent. Tones are rich and deep, never tinny and high are nice and crisp. Tone definition along the range is clear and distinct with no muddling up or smoothing along any part of the range. Just damn nice.<br /><br />
        Another thing occurs to me too with these. I always assumed that the wraparound neckband style phones would have some sort of adjustment that would accomodate people of different head/neck sizes. They don&#8217;t. But you know something? They fit <strong>perfectly</strong>. Is this some strange new universal constant? Is the distance from the back of the neck to the top of the ears the same for every person on the planet? Color me befuddled, but grateful.<br /><br />
        In short, I&#8217;m completely sold on Sennheiser products. These are just another in a very strong line of quality audio products, and I&#8217;d recommend them to anyone who tolerates me long enough to ask.
