<div class="post">
<p>I was pondering something yesterday, and it has continued being a background thread in my brain since then. It occurred to me that time tends to distort, and often completely obscure our ability to remember precise order of events, or specific memories. That&#8217;s all good. Expected and normal.<!--more--></p>

<p>This blog itself is one effort to mitigate those effects. In the future, I can refer back to old posts or particular months to remember what was going through my mind back then (now). However, the main point was to get some of those &#8216;pre-blog&#8217; events firmed up again. So that got me thinking about a good method for accomplishing that, and the first method that came to mind was using some sort of &#8216;timeline&#8217; type program or whatever. My brief searching around for such a thing yielded exactly NOTHING. Perhaps someone knows of such a thing? Please leave me a comment with such information.</p>

<p>Additionally, the idea popped into my head of using the blog software still, but pre-dating posts that I&#8217;d manufacture with those events. However, that doesn&#8217;t give any real sense for the duration of an event, which a timeline graphical representation certainly does. So what I&#8217;m looking for is something that does GANNT style sideways display of time, with bars representing events and their length showing duration. So I could put a singular event in that was just a large dot representing a moment in time, or a big fat line representing &#8230; like &#8230; a semester at school, or a particular trip (Europe, Little Red Wagon trip, etc).</p>

<p>Even one step further than that would be the ability to tie blog posts to the timeline as events as well, just something particularly notable could be tied into the timeline and vice versa. Gods of the UntraWeb, help me.</p>
