<div class="post">
<p>Every once in awhile, I get struck with some idea when I&#8217;m in bed, half asleep, and after that, my mind won&#8217;t rest as it explores the possibilities of that idea. I just had such a moment.</p>

<p>One thing we&#8217;ve been talking about recently is to revitalize our pencil/paper/dice RPG experience again, and I offered to GM. So I&#8217;m lying there almost asleep (having woken up to hit the bathroom or something), and it strikes me that I could modify the &#8216;stock&#8217; ad&amp;d d20 rules to emulate some of the rich gameplay that Asheron&#8217;s Call has. I&#8217;m going to make a few notes here to whet my appetite, and then start opening some documents to get this down more formally.<br />
<!--more--></p>

<p>First, to stress the &#8216;new world to explore&#8217; aspect of it. Asheron&#8217;s Call began with people being teleported into a new world, and immediately enslaved by the Olthoi. I would skip the enslavement part, but focus on the new world to explore part, and not make it quite so hostile right from the get go.</p>

<p>Second, portal magic. As in AC, there will be portals all over the &#8216;ley lines&#8217; of the world, and into it (into dungeons). Mastering those portals will be a large part of what gets people into trouble in the beginning. </p>

<p>Third, lifestones. I&#8217;m still working this one through, but I think a similar function might work well.</p>

<p>Fourth, salvaging and smithing. I wanted to have items be able to break down into components, effectively yielding &#8216;recipes&#8217; of a sort that the experienced &#8216;smith&#8217; of that type to use. There would be leathersmiths, weaponsmiths, woodsmiths, etc. &#8216;Salvaging&#8217;, as a skill, would be something that everyone has a sort of inate proficiency in, but would need to be trained in order to not suffer penalties, and to be able to salvage high level items. We&#8217;ll see how this works out in the mechanics of it.</p>

<p>Anyway, off I go to investigate this more formally. What a cool thing. *drool*</p>
