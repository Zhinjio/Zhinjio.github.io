<p>So after receiving the part mentioned a couple posts below, I ended up trying to put it in, and failing miserably. The distance of the holes from each other was just slightly too wide for the motherboard mounts. In frustration, I finally just called Asus. They indicated that they would send me a new one (of a different, more robust variety) for no charge. All I had to do was call their RMA department on Monday morning. So, I did so, yesterday morning when I got home from work, and they are sending one out to me.</p>

<p>The only additional comment they made was that, instead of mounting &#8216;straight&#8217; on the chip, this one had its mounts on the corners of the fan, and, as such, would be turned 45 degrees when mounted. Frankly, I don&#8217;t care if its standing on its head if it keeps the damn thing cool. Well, ok, and its 15mm or less in height. So I do care. So vaht &#8230; big deeeel.</p>
