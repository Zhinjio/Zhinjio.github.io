      This is actually the prequel to <em>The Davinci Code</em>, which was also excellent. Having read my fair share of conspiracy theory books, including many surrounding the Illuminatus and the Masons, I was pleased to see that he maintained about as much historical accuracy to those organizations as one is probably capable of anymore.<br /><br />
        The book was fast paced, almost too much so. It is perhaps my one critique of it, is that it flows almost too quickly. <em>The Davinci Code</em> was similar, seemingly having been written for the pacing of a two hour movie. It will be interesting to see if, when either or both of these hit the big screen, whether much had to be left out. Perhaps I am spoiled by the epic 2000 pagers, like <em>Focault&#8217;s Pendulum</em>, and desire more research and less action. But still, it was a pleasant read.<br /><br />
        The characters are engrossing, believable and passionate. The plot, while quick-paced, was almost never predictable, right to the very end. I even had one point where I thought I had it all figured out, only to be proven wrong several pages later. Nicely done, Mr. Brown. I will certainly continue to read his books as I find them.
