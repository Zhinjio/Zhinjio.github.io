          <h2>Busy week</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Sep 2005</p>

<p>Yeah, you might think, sure &#8230; you work 7 days on, and then you have 7 off. How could you possibly turn your &#8216;off&#8217; week into something busy? Well, I did. Yeah, fine &#8230; you might say that I filled it chock full of what would otherwise be considered liesure activities, that is true. But hey, I think that is what I earned having worked 85 hours the previous week. Is it not?<!--more--></p>

<p>I finished the Storm Constantine book I was reading, which wasn&#8217;t even on my reading list. Shame on me. I&#8217;ll have a review up of it shortly. Her books definitely leave me with a pretty sharp view of the world. Watched a couple movies, so I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have some comments on those as well. Played in pool league and lost to Skylar, my arch-nemesis (heh). Talked a bit of camera geekery with a couple friends, more to come on that topic as well, for certain. Got Dungeon Siege II, and played the hell out of that for a few days. Got a few new folks coming into the Partisan League in WoW, so that was some time as well. Oh, and don&#8217;t forget the first night of rolling up characters in the D&amp;D campaign I&#8217;m going to run.</p>

<p>Yeah, I had loads of time. I&#8217;ve had a lot on my mind. I&#8217;m going to be posting a bunch this week, I suspect. Keep your eyes on this space.</p>
