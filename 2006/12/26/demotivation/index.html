<p class="meta">26 Dec 2006</p>

<div class="post">
<p>So, I ordered posters from <a href="http://www.despair.com/">Despair, Inc</a> for my team for the Holidays. This site is just great. However, I was not quite prepared for the email I received when they initially processed my order. I simply could not stop laughing. Decidedly without permission, I repost almost the entirety of that for your perusal below&#8230;<!--more--></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for your recent order from Despair, Inc.</p>

  <p>I&#8217;d like to personally welcome you to our growing body of<br />
Dissatisfied Customers(tm), but to do so might evidence<br />
some actual concern for service and protocol. This might<br />
then lead to customer satisfaction, which would defeat<br />
the purpose altogether. That is why you have received<br />
this generic, form-generated email, written by some<br />
nameless lackey in our marketing department.</p>

  <p>Having established that any pretense of consideration<br />
for *your* needs would be counter-productive to our<br />
raison d&#8217;etre at Despair Inc, let us now ponder a<br />
subject of greater interest to those among us who are<br />
worthy of both of our collective attentions &#8211; that<br />
person being me.</p>

  <p>While you sit there wincing in disbelief at these<br />
bons mots of authentic insincerity and vexed by the<br />
intrinsic contradictions, I find I am beside myself<br />
with awe at the specimen of unparalleled angst that<br />
is our most recent Despair Catalog. Hardly a man<br />
given to superlatives, I must nevertheless assert with<br />
David-Lee-Rothian boldness that we are demonstrably<br />
without peer in the Art of Demotivation?. </p>

  <p>And speaking of &#8220;The Art of Demotivation&#8221;, my<br />
management treatise of the same name is<br />
available for purchase, and in three unique<br />
editions (four if you count the&#8230; oops, I&#8217;ve said<br />
too much already).</p>

  <p>While I could praise the book and by extension myself<br />
without end, I will instead, in the interest of<br />
at least some pretense of humility, simply note<br />
that no less a journalist than Lucy Kellaway of<br />
the respected Financial Times of London wrote of<br />
the book, &#8220;The Art of Demotivation is the most<br />
daring, funny and subversive management book ever<br />
written.&#8221;</p>

  <p>In short, I&#8217;m the best.</p>

  <p>For those eager to learn more about this landmark<br />
work, pay a visit to the delightful guided tour that<br />
is offered at our exclusive book website:</p>

  <p>http://www.demotivation.com</p>

  <p>Those ordering Chairman editions of the Art<br />
of Demotivation are reminded that each necessarily<br />
entails a slight shipping delay. Each one of these<br />
signed and numbered objets d&#8217;art is handbound<br />
upon the receipt of your order.</p>

  <p>At long last, after this lengthy exploitation of your<br />
attention for purely selfish marketing purposes, let<br />
us move on to yet another advertisement for our<br />
company.</p>

  <p>Despair is ever consumed in the product development<br />
process. In fact, as we speak, the small cabal of<br />
dispirited creators have thrown themselves back into<br />
the further development of our new Despair video series.<br />
Those interested in getting a glimpse at life inside<br />
the very incorporation of Despair itself can view<br />
the videos online at:</p>

  <p>http://www.despair.com/spin.html</p>

  <p>In anticipation of your next question- yes, these<br />
videos and other videos are coming to a DVD Player<br />
near you in 2007. And, as always, the audience<br />
first to be informed of the release of future videos<br />
(and the DVD itself) remains the subscribers of our<br />
e-mail newsletter, &#8220;The Wailing List&#8221;. So join the<br />
list now- don&#8217;t make us come get you.</p>

  <p>If any of the information shown below is inaccurate,<br />
please notify us immediately using our new Troubled Ticketing<br />
system.</p>

  <p>http://www.despair.com/trti.html</p>

  <p>We will rectify your error immediately, and on some occasions,<br />
without snickering.</p>

  <p>It is the least we can do, which, as a matter of policy,<br />
is the most we can do.</p>

  <p>Sincerely not really writing you this email,<br />
E.L.</p>

  <p>E.L.Kersten, Ph.D.<br />
Founder &amp; COO,<br />
Despair, Inc.</p>
