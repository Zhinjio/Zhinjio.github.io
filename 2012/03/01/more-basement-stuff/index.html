          <h2>More basement stuff</h2>
<p class="meta">01 Mar 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p>We&#8217;re really getting close now. Plumbing is 90% done. Basement electrical trim is done (there are a few items upstairs still to do). They&#8217;re going to be starting carpet tomorrow after a thorough cleanup. Fish tank goes downstairs tomorrow as well, and possibly the trim around the tank if they get time. We&#8217;ll have a trimout inspection probably early next and final walkthrough next week. Amazing journey, this.</p>

<p>The daily pictures are posted here:</p>

<p>You do need to be in my circles on G+ if you want to see that stuff, though, so circle me if you can&#8217;t see them and let me know, and I&#8217;ll circle you back promptly.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also done almost all of the wiring closet wiring at this point as well, and I&#8217;m very happy with the result. All CAT6 runs done, all RG6 runs done, all speaker runs done. The only remaining work is a couple more cables that come from the tv (2 HDMI, 1 VGA, a couple more RG6, etc). I still have to mount things like the infrared distribution thinger, the RG6 cable splitter, the UPS. I need to cut and put up the other time wireframe shelves too. They will hold the receiver, cable box/dvr, my two servers, the slingbox, the NAS and um&#8230; oh, the DVD player. I think that is it. All the wallplate work still remains. That should be pretty easy though, just a matter of getting around the room with some free time and doing it.</p>

<p>I was really pleased to see that the CAT6 keystone are punchdown and not crimp. My hands are just not as capable of hours of crimping cable like they used to. Punchdown is easy. The RG6 compression crimp is NOTHING compared to CAT5/6 cable ends. I&#8217;m actually contemplating hitting up one of the local network cable supply stores for a whole mess of 1&#8242;, 3&#8242; and 6&#8242; patch cables. Need to price that out and see if its reasonable and worth it. I&#8217;m sure they hire some kind of slave labor or college kids or something to crimp cables, so I&#8217;m really just pumping money into the economy, right? Right?</p>

<p>What else&#8230; not much I guess. It is a lot quieter now that all the saws and cutting and stuff is done. Its so close now that we&#8217;re getting into the sort of anxious excitement mode now to have our space back. Very ready for that, to be sure.</p>

<p>I have no idea what we&#8217;re going to do furniture-wise yet. There are a few items that were not damaged in the flood that we kept, and they will probably go down pretty quickly to start making the space usable again, but there are definitely a bunch of things we&#8217;re going to need to buy again, and not all of it (in fact, not most of it) will be covered by insurance. So it may take a little bit to get everything restocked, so to speak. In rough order of purchasing, I suspect it will go something like: couch, desk(s), shelving, exercise bike, guestroom bed, and then miscellaneous stuff like end tables and whatever else we need to fill out the space nicely.</p>

<p>As far as where everything is going to go&#8230; I really have no idea. The only &#8220;fixed&#8221; things are the couch, tv spot and the fish tank. The fish tank is going to be a huge project. We are definitely going to have to start it out fresh water, though I think the long term goal (once money permits) is to get back into a reef setup. The startup costs on that are going to be huge. Rough estimates say to have one pound of live rock for every gallon of water. So 250 lbs at roughly $4-$6/lb. Yeah. Now you&#8217;re with me. And that doesn&#8217;t include any of the ancillary gear you need like protein skimmers, more pumps, filtration, blah blah blah. Oh yeah, and something living. Both reef fish and corals are all on the high side of cost (at least when compared to fresh water fish). I think for the fresh water setup I will probably need some more substrate to add to what I had just purchased for the 75gal. tank. I should be able to get away with inert stuff since what I got before is good quality. A few plants, probably 1 or 2 pumps for circulation and probably some additional heating. The glass covers need to be replaced, and I want to get better quality lighting as well. I need to take a good look at the filter that came with it as well, and whether or not I can use it in conjunction with my existing eheim. If not, I&#8217;ll probably pick up another eheim. So it will be more in the order of a few hundred dollars, not a few thousand. Might not happen on day 1, but it won&#8217;t be too long in waiting either. Since it is such a central part of the new look of the basement, I&#8217;d really like to have it up and running as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I need to get some sleep&#8230; more to come very soon, with hopefully some final thoughts on this whole basement epic once they have wrapped up here in a week or so.</p>
