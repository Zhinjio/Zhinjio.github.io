          <h2>Leg</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Jul 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p>The final leg of the journey went fine, and sleep-less-ness aside, all is well. I sat out on he porch (pictures forthcoming) by myself for about 30-45 minutes once we got settled in. It was about 11am local time, and maybe 70 degrees out. There was a slight wind constantly going (as is normal here), and the bliss feeling was nearly instantaneous. My earlier complaining about the process of travel, while not invalid, was quickly outweighed by the benefits of being here in particular. I do really like it. The view is awesome off the porch. There is nothing going on here except us relaxing. No pressure to do anything or see anyone. This is, by far, the way I prefer to travel. I think we have two actual agenda items to hit while we&#8217;re here, and no particular day those things need to happen.</p>

<p>One is to get the kids to the beach here. There will likely be some minor stress associated with that, but no more than normal kid-wrangling for any outing, anywhere. And the second is to go fishing. No idea what is in season right now, and honestly, it is more for Madeline than me. But I&#8217;d like her to see the whole process anyway. I have no idea what she&#8217;ll think of it. She might not like it at all. Sometimes she is utterly fascinated by things that squick other kids (Zombies), and other times, the smallest things frighten her (vacuums). Its hard to predict. Right now, it seems like she is hesitating, so we&#8217;ll try to come up with a way to sell it. She&#8217;s also never been on a boat before, so that might be a challenge in and of itself.</p>

<p>Nearly finishing with Game of Thrones (first book). Not sure how I feel about it. It probably would have been better to read it BEFORE watching the show, to be completely fair. I am struck by how well the show has stuck to the book. Normally, there is so much license taken with making something &#8220;screen-worthy&#8221; that you either lose a lot of content, or you end up adding in things that were just flat out never the author&#8217;s intent. But so far, omissions have been small. I did bring the second book with me as well. I may take a break from that series to read one of the others I&#8217;ve brought though. We&#8217;ll see, I suppose.</p>

<p>And this brings up the one rationale I can possibly come up with to own a tablet reader device. Travel. I probably will read half of what I brought with me, and books just add significant weight to everything. I&#8217;d certainly much rather tote around a 20 oz. tablet with all my books on it than all the books themselves. And certainly, technical references are the same example. I can lug around a bookshelf worth of O&#8217;Reilly stuff, or a tablet with all the PDFs. Duh. Easy sell. Now that I&#8217;m focusing on management instead of pure technical stuff though, maybe that day has passed for me. In most work scenarios, I&#8217;m also going to have internet access from either a laptop or main machine, so the reasons break down there to some extent as well.</p>

<p>It just occurred to me that these long stream-of-consciousness posts are decidedly anti-blogorific. Blogs that are well read (at least, by me) tend to be focused on single topics and explore them thoroughly, as opposed to traipsing all over the current day&#8217;s thoughts. Maybe I&#8217;m forging a new path. Or maybe I&#8217;m just limiting who is likely to read this. Ah well. IyamwhatIyam.</p>

<p>More later.</p>
