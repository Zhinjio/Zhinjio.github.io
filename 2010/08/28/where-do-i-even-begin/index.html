<p>See, if I wasn&#8217;t so lazy about updating this, I would not face this particular conundrum.<!--more--></p>

<p>Life just keeps moving right along, despite our best efforts. Once again, I will make an attempt to keep this damn thing up to date, but I suspect it will meet with the same untimely end that all such efforts in the past have met. Once more into the breach, eh?</p>

<p>Our second child is on the way. I suspect that its long enough into the process that most of the early dangers of that have passed, and we are looking at a due date of the beginning of March, roughly. We have yet to determine the gender (a bit early yet). In my thoughts so far, I don&#8217;t think I have any real preference one way or another. We were talking the other day, and it occurred to me that from a mindset of &#8220;Collect Them All!&#8221;, we really should now have a boy. While my obsessive nature tends to such things in games and other pursuits, in my head, I can&#8217;t really say that it carries over to the gender of my children. Though it has certainly already been genetically determined, I&#8217;m really going to be all set so long as he or she is healthy. That is, by far, the more important thing.</p>

<p>Playing WoW again. Shocker, eh? I don&#8217;t know. I took a long break from it, played a lot of Facebook games, a few more console games and a few other PC games. I have certainly not lost my lust for such things, but I do find myself going back to WoW for some kind of strange comfort thing. I&#8217;m not sure I can adequately explain. Playing on Eldre&#8217;thalas again with Jabby&#8217;s group (<a href="http://astralorder.com/" target="_blank">TAO</a>). It is hopefully going to remain a relatively small group of friends that regularly runs 10 mans together, and not much more than that. I can really only do it one day a week anyway, so my view into the content will (as usual) be somewhat limited. Cataclysm is due to come out late this year. I suspect November-ish. In the meantime, I&#8217;m having fun running heroics, seeing some of the 5 man content I&#8217;ve not done before, and trying to gear up. All my usual <a href="http://www.warcraftpets.com/account/profile.asp?user=zhinjio#col">obsessions</a> and wastes of time in game are still present, of course.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve returned back to my thoughts on writing a book while I job search. I have one particularly good idea that is floating to the top, and I&#8217;m hoping to get some meat into its bones soon. We&#8217;ll see, I suppose.</p>

<p>Ah well, its late, I&#8217;ll try to post more tomorrow.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>
