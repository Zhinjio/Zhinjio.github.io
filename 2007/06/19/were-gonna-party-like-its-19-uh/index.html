<p>So yeah. Another year, another <a href="http://geostock.trippy.org/">Geostock</a>.<!--more--></p>

<p>This year was a bunch of fun. I believe it was widely acknowledged as one of the better ones in recent memory. I&#8217;m sure if I sat down and sorted through the jumble of what parts I do remember, some reasons for that would become apparent. But whatever &#8230; I&#8217;m not sure its necessary to dissect.</p>

<p>GregA held up the Florida representation on his own this year. I do believe he kept up their end of the proverbial agreement. Groot, Mongoose in the nizzle as always. Nimdok made a showing after a year&#8217;s absence. Pan and TomA continue to keep up their neat perfect attendance records. Marcia/Jim were there through all of Saturday, par usual. Jeff and Lori and dawgs. Amanda came by with a friend of hers &#8230; she hasn&#8217;t been here in a couple of years. The Rhino made it out with significant other Angie. He selected his victims carefully, and didn&#8217;t exactly escape unscathed either (there are rumors of him weeping late Saturday night which I will neither confirm nor deny). Dar made it for the second year in a row. Ella&#8217;s Mom and Sister were present. Keith made it on Saturday despite some heavy travelling in the days prior. Several folks from Ella&#8217;s graduating class stopped by as well, including Mickey! Bah &#8230; trying to get everyone in without forgetting anyone is just dumb. My apologies to those not mentioned explicitly.</p>

<p>Oh &#8230; I should mention that the Potts crew (this year: Sabin, Stephanie, Crystal and Kevin), brought along a new penis cake that has pretty much raised the bar on all future such attempts. This one was able to stand up under its own power. Or something. I actually had a hard time cutting it up to serve, feeling strangely unable to take a knife to its &#8230; uh &#8230; anatomy. Well done, and thanks for coming by!</p>

<p>So now we&#8217;re in the usual week or so of after party cleanup. We&#8217;ll be finding bottles and random stuff in strange places in the house for probably the next month or so. And there&#8217;s a bit of relief. Despite the craziness and fun &#8230; its a somewhat stressful thing to throw together something designed to entertain 50 people for 2-3 straight days.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who was able to make it another special year.</p>
