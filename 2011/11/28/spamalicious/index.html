<p>Ok, so this is awesome. Yeah, sure, we all get spam email all the time. This one, however, caught my eye for no good reason I can think of. Once I read it all the way through, I saved it for posterity&#8217;s sake. Also, this is probably only going to be funny to those who know of TrippyMUSH. Here is the email, with bits knocked out to protect &#8230; well, me, probably.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Greetings,</p>

  <p>My name is xxxxxx xxxxxxx, and I would like to present you with a business opportunity that offers the potential for considerable earnings.</p>

  <p>I work for a privately held manufacturing company, which currently purchases a specific product vital to its processing operations at a price significantly above the manufacturing cost. In my proposed business venture, you would act as a stand-in supplier, providing this key material while retaining the same profit margins. My role would be to introduce you to my company as the supplier and to obtain a contract between you and my employer.</p>

  <p>I understand that your experience with TrippyMUSH Inc doesn&#8217;t directly relate to my field. However, this venture is more in line with your personal capabilities rather than your professional experience.</p>

  <p>I would like to confirm your current phone number xxx-xxx-xxxx. Please send a return email to verify your contact number and to schedule the most convenient time to discuss these possibilities in detail. I look forward to speaking with you soon.</p>

  <p>Kindest Regards,</p>

<p>Awesomesauce. Pure &#8230; awesomesauce. Ok, maybe its only funny to me. Who knows.</p>
