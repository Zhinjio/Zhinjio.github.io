          <h2>Step back sometimes</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>I had a conversation last weekend reminding me that we all too often spend our mental energy on all the wrong sorts of anxieties. I don&#8217;t mean our passions or interests&#8230; I mean the things we choose to stress or worry about.</p>

<p>So, due to circumstances that are often out of our own control, we sometimes find ourselves separated from our loved ones, sometimes for extended periods of time. Imagine for a moment that loved one is your son (or daughter), and that you haven&#8217;t seen them in 15 years. And when you did, they were 14 years old. Yes, you might argue&#8230; that is perhaps an extreme case, and you&#8217;d be right. But uncommon? Unheard of? No&#8230; I think probably all too common, in fact. Anyway&#8230;</p>

<p>Now imagine that you head back to your hometown for a family gathering of some sort. You hear that your son is in town, but really have no way of knowing how to reach them or meet up. Imagine that you decide to hit the old haunts on a particular evening, and then, without any warning, you see your now 29 year old son sitting at the end of the bar, throwing back a beer. You approach, and the following conversation ensues&#8230;</p>

<p>him : Do I know you?<br />
you : Yes, you do.<br />
him : How long have I known you?<br />
you : 29 years<br />
him : Are you saying what I think you&#8217;re saying?</p>

<p>And then for the next several hours, you find yourselves picking up the pieces and learning about each other again, discovering and sharing.</p>

<p>Makes all of the other crap infesting my brain all seem rather trite by comparison. It also started another thread internally that I haven&#8217;t quite flushed out yet, but will post about soon.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing, Tom. I won&#8217;t soon forget this.</p>
