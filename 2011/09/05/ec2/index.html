<p>So <a title="Amazon Web Services" href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon (Web Services)</a> has a service called EC2, which is essentially their hosting service. Due to some stuff I&#8217;m working on at work, I have been taking a look at what kinds of service automation are possible, and that led me to look at EC2.<!--more--></p>

<p>So the first thing that is interesting to me is that their hosting model is based *entirely* on usage of their resources. Which, I mean, that makes sense, right? Assuming you can commoditize all the pieces of it in some kind of meaningful way. Storage, CPU, RAM, etc&#8230; assuming you can assign per minute/hour/day kinds of numbers to that. And if you aren&#8217;t running some kind of major site that gets monstrous hits or requires huge storage, I can see this model being VERY attractive.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m making an attempt to map some of the websites I have to this sort of model, and see what might make sense to move over to that.</p>

<p>Further reading on the subject shows the possibility of using their S3 storage buckets for static websites as well. There is a huge community and effort among tech folks to use this sort of solution. All kinds of little mini-projects and products being developed to take things that would normally be very dynamic content (like say, this blog), and host it in a static form. It removes a HUGE amount of overhead with all the blog software and CPU intensive stuff if you can swing it.</p>

<p>That reading also led me down the road of website optimization. Wow. So I&#8217;ve been living under a rock for a few years, apparently.</p>

<p>Long story short: I&#8217;m going to be throwing up some blog posts describing and/or documenting some of my travels down the road of using EC2 with some of the above goals. We&#8217;ll see what comes of it.</p>
