<p>So I had a great InternetExperience(tm) a week or so ago.</p>

<p>A few weeks back, someone on&#8230; I think <a href="http://plus.google.com/" title="Google Plus" target="_blank">G+</a>, linked me to an artist I had never heard about on youtube. I think the &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrpTgV6l27I" title="deer park, by tripswitch" target="_blank">deer park</a>&#8221; video if I&#8217;m not mistaken. Alright, so I dig it. I make myself a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7C00D4A61B4EA064" title="tripswitch youtube playlist" target="_blank">youtube playlist</a> out of it. A youtube feature I had never before played with. Congrats on making that completely simple to do.</p>

<p>This becomes, just through the pleasure of listening to it, my default thing to listen to while doing anything on my computer at home for the next several weeks. I am reminded that Christmas is coming up when I mention it, and so I go searching for the CDs. Amazon gives me no love. Oh, and its worth mentioning right here that I am searching for the physical media, not just an iTunes download. @set me=grognard. *shrug*</p>

<p>So I poke around some more, get some more info about the artist, etc, and spend about the next two hours finding out more about this guy, and ultimately, not finding anyplace that sells his stuff. Blah. The best I get is <a href="http://www.psymbolic.com/unlock.html?key=/artists/tripswitch" title="Tripswitch page at Psymbolic" target="_blank">this page</a>. It seems he signed up with them a few years ago. No CDs there, but it was late, I was tired, and the &#8220;contact&#8221; link was just too inviting. I did not have really high hopes, but what the hell. My expectation at this point is a polite form letter in response telling me that stuff is out of print, yadda yadda, have a nice day.</p>

<p>To my very pleasant surprise, I get an email less than 24 hours later FROM THE ARTIST HIMSELF. Now that is what the internet is all about, goddamnit. I love that. He was kind enough to hook me up <a href="http://www.sectionrecords.com/" title="Section Records" target="_blank">this website</a>, which he indicated (by the quick examination of the box at his feet) had about 15 copies of the album I wanted, still in stock. A short transaction later, and my order is in! Now that is just awesome.</p>

<p>We exchanged a few emails after that, chatted about artist&#8217;s rights, physical vs. digital media, and BigMusicCorp and such, and so I&#8217;m happy to push more business his way if my little corner of the Internet should happen to enjoy his music as much as I have. Thanks Nick! A pleasure doing business with you. Don&#8217;t stop making cool music for me to listen to!</p>
