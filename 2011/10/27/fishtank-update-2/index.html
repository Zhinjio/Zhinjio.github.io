<div class="post">
<p>The remaining substrate arrived yesterday. I hit Home Depot on the way home, and predictably, they didn&#8217;t have exactly the kind of peat moss I wanted. They had one kind which was &#8220;enriched&#8221;, a Miracle-Gro product, which was supplemented with extra fertilizers or something. I&#8217;m fairly certain I didn&#8217;t want that kind of thing leeching its goo into my tank. I ended up with something that is probably slightly less than ideal, but whatever.</p>

<p>I drained the tank down, which invariably leaves about 1-2cm of water in the bottom of the tank. That complicated laying down the moss since it essentially just floated. Ah well, it just meant that my first layer (Amazonia + Laterite) had to sort of &#8230; hold down the moss. It took a bit of playing with, but I think I managed it. Then came the layers of Eco-complete, mixing the red and black bags in to get a decent layering and some attempt to tier it up in the back as well. I think it looks pretty decent. I took a few snaps of it, but haven&#8217;t pulled anything off the camera yet.</p>

<p>Since I also got the replacement filters, I also pulled apart the canister and put the fresh ones in. No real issue there, primed it again, got everything going. Unfortunately, in doing so, I spotted a leak down there. Not a major one. For the moment, a towel underneath is good enough, but there will be a part under there that is going to get a new seal pretty soon here.</p>
