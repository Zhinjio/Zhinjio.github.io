<div class="post">
<p>I&#8217;m sitting here watching TV. Its some political punditry or another. It doesn&#8217;t matter which one, and it doesn&#8217;t matter which ideology. If you read deeply enough into my various postings that either dodge around the edge of my political views or state them overtly&#8230; you can get a good sense for how I feel about things. But that isn&#8217;t the point here.</p>

<p>Here is the point. I think we are in the process of reaching a node. A Pivot Point. A junction in the way that politics, commerce, finance, culture and people function in this country, and&#8230; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m stretching too far here, the world.</p>

I&#8217;ve never personally seen something like this. I was born during another one of these points (Vietnam War), but wasn&#8217;t old enough to know it was going on, let alone form an opinion about it. Since around the moment when I started becoming self-aware enough to look at the world around me (say, age 10 or so)&#8230; I was still too focused on playing baseball, riding my bike, and trading baseball cards with my friends. And then? At that point, in that year, was the beginning of the end that we are now facing. Ok, not &#8220;end&#8221;, per se&#8230; but like I just said&#8230; this &#8230; inflection point (I steal from the show I&#8217;m watching, shamelessly).</h1>

<p>My problem with all of this? I really and truly fear what is to come next. I weep&#8230; yes, weep real tears, EVERY DAY right now, watching the events unfold in this country. I used to think, not even very long ago, that moving to &lt;insert another country here&gt; would fix it. But it won&#8217;t. This goes beyond this country. It extends to all the sovereign countries participating in the global economy. All the countries participating in the ideologies of self-righteousness, fear and hatred. I love this country. I truly do. I marvel, in wide-eyed awe, at the institutions, documents, policies and foresight this country&#8217;s founders put in place so many years ago. Their durability, flexibility and belief in a dream that has persisted through some of the most trying experiences that nations have ever faced. But even these, so steadfast and resolute in their ability to adapt to changing times, could not stand up to the onslaught of greed, corruption and just flat-out ignorance that has led to where we are now.</p>

<p>Shame on us. Not all of us. That would be unfair. But alot of us. I count myself among those to blame. I was &#8230; lazy, unwilling to push my stake in the ground and stand up for the things that might have made a difference earlier. It is arguable that nothing I could have done in the past decade (or more) would have changed any outcomes. It could also reasonably be argued that I did, in fact, participate in the more local, philosophical ways that I did. But I don&#8217;t want to dwell on the past. What is more important is what is happening now.</p>

<p>We live in a broken system. Nearly every aspect of our lives is dictated by corruption and greed. Please. Now is the time. Stand up for what you believe in, talk to everyone around you. Get people motivated about making things right. Whatever the mechanism of change will be&#8230; participate in it. &lt;/insert&gt;</p>
